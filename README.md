# ShapeShifter: Robust Physical Adversarial Attack on Faster R-CNN Object Detector

## Overview

This is the code repository for the ECML-PKDD 2018 paper: **ShapeShifter: Robust Physical Adversarial Attack on Faster R-CNN Object Detector**

The arXiv version is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05810

The code included here reproduces our techniques presented in the paper. 

In this work, we tackle the more challenging problem of crafting physical adversarial perturbations to fool image-based object detectors like Faster R-CNN.
Attacking an object detector is more difficult than attacking an image classifier, as it needs to mislead the classification results in multiple bounding boxes with different scales.
Our approach can generate perturbed stop signs that are consistently mis-detected by Faster R-CNN as other objects, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and other safety-critical computer vision systems.

Snapshots of the drive-by test results. In (a), the person perturbation was detected 38% of the frames as a person and only once as a stop sign. The perturbation in (b) was detected 11% of the time as a sports ball and never as a stop sign. The untargeted perturbation in (c) was never detected as a stop sign or anything else.
